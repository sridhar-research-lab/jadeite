The files in this folder are generated by running the "execRun.sh"

"results_... .csv" files contain the results of running Jarhead on the "test" and "train" dataset (each has two sub-folders: "ben", which is benign and "mal", which is malicious)

The "Jarhead_Accuracy.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook file that takes "results_test_ben.csv" and "results_test_mal.csv" files and computes the results (accuracy, f-score ...) for the Jarhead approach (on our testing data only).
